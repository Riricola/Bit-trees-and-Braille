In this project, I created 3 files. One contains the BitTree class, whicih sores mappings from bits to values.
Second is BrailleASCIITables which translates from ASCII to braille, Braille to ASCII, and braille to unicode.
Lastly is BrailleASCII which ocntains the main file that translates the string you specify in the method you'd
like to translate it to (order goes translateType followed by the word or bits).

Acknowledgements can be found within BitTree.java
